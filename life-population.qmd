title: "Life Expectancy and Population"

This page will explore the relationship between life expectancy and population for all countries in all years in the Gapminder dataset.

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("./gapminder.csv")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Scatterplot of Life Expectancy and Population
```{r}
ggplot(data=gapminder, mapping = aes(x=life_expectancy, y=population_millions))+
geom_point(alpha = 0.4)+
labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. Population", x = "Life Expectancy (years)", y="Population (millions)")
```

Upon looking at this plot of life expectancy and population, we see that countries with higher life expectancies also seem to also have a higher population on average. However, this relationship isn't as pronounced compared to life expectancy and GDP, as there are many countries with low GDPs that also have a wide range of life expectancy at the lower y-values.
