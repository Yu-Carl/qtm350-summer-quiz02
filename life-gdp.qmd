title: "Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita"

This page will explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita for all countries in all years in the Gapminder dataset.

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("./gapminder.csv")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Scatterplot of Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita
```{r}
ggplot(data=gapminder, mapping = aes(x=life_expectancy, y=gdp_per_capita))+
geom_point(alpha = 0.4)+
labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita", x = "Life Expectancy (years)", y="GDP per Capita")
```

Upon looking at this plot of life expectancy and GDP per capita, we see that countries with higher life expectancies also tend to have a higher GDP per capita on average.
